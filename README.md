# Institutional Implications for Revenue Choice: An Analysis of Fiscal Behavior in Colorado

**Presentation for [2014 National Tax Association Conference](http://www.ntanet.org/images/stories/pdf/nta_cot107th2014_web.pdf)**

This talk will be given during the panel scheduled for 1:45 PM on Thursday, November 13th, 2014.  It covers preliminary research into the revelation of voter prefereces with respect to [tax and expenditure limitations in Colorado](http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&blobheader=application%2Fpdf&blobkey=id&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobwhere=1239165968612&ssbinary=true).  Specifically, the research asks whether or not exemption votes (i.e. ["de-Brucing"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Bruce)) can be predicted from 1) [socioeconomic factors](http://censtats.census.gov/usa/usa.shtml) and 2) [ballot initiative components](http://ccionline.org/info-center-library/research-miscellaneous-publications/) (conditional on #1).
