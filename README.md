**Presentation for [2014 National Tax Association Conference](http://www.ntanet.org/images/stories/pdf/nta_cot107th2014_web.pdf)**

This talk will be given during the panel scheduled for 10:15 AM on Thursday, November 13th, 2014.  It covers preliminary research into the revelation of voter prefereces with respect to [tax and expenditure limitations in Colorado](http://www.colorado.gov/cs/Satellite?blobcol=urldata&blobheader=application%2Fpdf&blobkey=id&blobtable=MungoBlobs&blobwhere=1239165968612&ssbinary=true).  Specifically, the research asks whether or not exemption votes (i.e. "de-Brucing") can be predicted from 1) socioeconomic factors and 2) ballot initiative components (conditional on #1).
